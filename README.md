# Bike_Rentals_DC

This project aims to analyse and predict bike rentals in the city of Washington D.C. We use Machine Learning in Scikit-Learn and Pycaret to be able to predict the hourly bike rentals in the city. 

The notebook "GroupC_Notebook_Assignment2.ipynb" contains all the analysis.

The streamlit file "GroupC_StreamlitSrc_Assignment2.py" contains the dashboard and a better visual representation of our findings. You can run it via your terminal by typing "streamlit run GroupC_StreamlitSrc_Assignment2.py".
